# RBAC UI Dashboard
## RBAC UI Dashboard is a web application designed for Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) management. It provides an intuitive user interface to manage users, roles, and permissions for any system implementing RBAC. Built with React, it allows admins to perform tasks such as creating and managing roles, assigning permissions to users, and ensuring a smooth user experience for handling access control.
